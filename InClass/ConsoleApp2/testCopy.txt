from the system.IO namespace
Common operations include (with names that are pretty straightforward)

    File.Exists(filePath): test if it exists
    File.Delete(filePath)
    File.WriteAllLines(filePath, string[]to write): overwrites the file
    File.AppendAllLines(filePath, string[]to append)
    File.Copy(filePath, targetPath, whether to overwrite)
        If the third param is false, it will raise an IOException if file already exists.
